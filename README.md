# FreshRSS extensions

This repository contains all my [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS) extensions.

To install an extension, download [the extension archive](https://github.com/DevonHess/FreshRSS-Extensions/archive/main.zip) first and extract it on your PC.
Then, upload the specific extension(s) you want on your server.
Extensions must be in the `./extensions` directory of your FreshRSS installation.
